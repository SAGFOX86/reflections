When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on a group project.  When you have an issue with a curret project and want input from others 
who may be able to help you solve a bug, or issue with current project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

you wouldnt want someone editing your work, or you might be working on a new concept for your project,
and you're not quite ready for it to be public. so you wouldnt want to automatically push or pull from either 
your remote hub, or from your local pc to the remote hub.
