How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

i have not yet viewed 2 different versions of a file yet.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    it could be easier to see any changes and possible mistakes that occured and when they occured. like if you know when your website worked properly before, and then it started acting up, you could go to exactly when it started having a problem

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    pros are you dont have multiple copies unnescessarially being saved and wasting space.

    cons, you could have needed a back up created and it didnt.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    it depends on what kind of project you are doing to which editer. or version control system you are using. one would be good to compare 2 seperate files, while comparing different states of the same file could be useful as well.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
   
   

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
